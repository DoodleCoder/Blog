set() is used to show the obj to the front-end 

find('all') is used to obtain all the tuples.

get(id) is used to get a particular tuple.

compact(ABC) returns an array with keys-ABC and values-<value of ABC>

comments foreign key to article
In CommentsTable add $this->belongsTo('Articles');
In ArticlesTable add $this->hasMany('Comments');

In view.ctp
<?php
	echo $this->Form->create(null,['url' => ['controller' => 'Comments','action' => 'add']]);	  //direct to CommentsController and to add fn
	echo $this->Form->control('Write A Comment', ['rows' => '3','name' => 'content']);       //name as the table name in DB
?>
	<input type="hidden" name="article_id" value='<?= $article->id ?>'>  		  //sending article_id along 
<?php
	echo $this->Form->button(__('Post Comment'));
	echo $this->Form->end();
?>

To get the user id:
$variable->user_id = $this->Auth->user('id');
*must have the user_id column in the table.

redirect back to the page by:
return $this->redirect(['controller'=>'Articles', 'action' => 'view', $comment->article_id]);
**you take article_id when calling and make sure you have a column in the table.
